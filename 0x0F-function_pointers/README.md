# Project: 0x0F. C - Function pointers

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<h3>General</h3>

<ul>
<li>What are function pointers and how to use them</li>
<li>What does a function pointer exactly hold</li>
<li>Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tasks</h2>

| Task | File |
| ---- | ---- |
| 0. What's my name | [0-print_name.c](./0-print_name.c) |
| 1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done | [1-array_iterator.c](./1-array_iterator.c) |
| 2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities | [2-int_index.c](./2-int_index.c) |
| 3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at | [3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h](./3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h) |
